### About StaticGen

This leaderboard is maintained by [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com), a hosting service that gives static sites a leg up in a web dominated by databases.

People sometimes ask if static sites make sense for anything beyond a one-pager. This leaderboard highlights the top open source projects, in many different languages, that make static sites not only viable, but an attractive option for creating sophisticated websites!
