### The Rules

Everybody is welcome to contribute to StaticGen, just fork the [Github repo](https://github.com/bitballoon/staticgen) and send a pull request.
Each static site generator is a markdown file in the `source/projects` directory.

We'll only accept pull requests adding new static site generators if they follow the following rules:

*   **Static Site Generation:** No "flat-file CMSs" or similar tools. The program must be able to output a static website that can be hosted in places like BitBalloon, S3 or Github Pages.
*   **Open Source:** The generator must have a public repository on Github that we can link to and pull in stats from.
*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other static site generators in `source/projects`.
