PieCrust is a static website generator that’s all managed with text files. No
complex setup, databases, or administrative panels. Simple, beautiful, and
yummy.

PieCrust makes creating and maintaining a website as easy as pie:

- Simple filling: it’s all just text files!
- Store in the cellar: your whole website fits nicely in a revision control
  system.
- Bake and serve: generate a completely static website that will run with
  minimum resources for maximum scalability.
- Taste while you cook: preview your website instantly during authoring.

PieCrust uses all the ingredients you already like:

- Markdown and Textile for formatting.
- Twig (a Jinja/Django-like templating engine) and Mustache for writing layouts
  and re-usable bits of markup.
- Less, Sass and Compass for your CSS needs.
- YUICompressor for optimization.
