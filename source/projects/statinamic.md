## Easy to use

Write your content in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files.
Implement your design with JavaScript files, using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

No template language to learn. Just JavaScript (or JSX if you like it).

You can just grab some packages on the [NPM ecosystem](http://npmjs.org/)
to help you building your website, blog or even your small app.

_Statinamic_ will help you to generate and deploy a generated website in a
breath.


## Static and dynamic?

The technology
([React](http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome)).
used to generate pages can render pages on both client and server
(~~Isomorphic~~ [Universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9)
rendering).
So when the client has established a connection with your website, they can get
the same UX as an app by grabbing the minimal amount of data for each new page.


## Choose your flavor

The way Statinamic is done helps you to customize everything:
choose your own Markdown engine (with your own plugins), your CSS preprocessor, etc
thanks to Webpack.

## Awesome DX (Developer Experience)

During development, enjoy the benefit of hot loading with visual errors in your layout !
